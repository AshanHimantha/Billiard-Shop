echo "Authentication Test Summary:"
echo "=============================="
echo ""
echo "âœ… Implemented complete authentication system with:"
echo "   â€¢ AuthContext for managing user state"
echo "   â€¢ ProtectedRoute component for route guards"
echo "   â€¢ Login/logout functionality with role-based routing"
echo "   â€¢ Session persistence using localStorage"
echo ""
echo "ðŸ”’ Protected Routes:"
echo "   â€¢ /admin/* - Admin only (stations, reports, credits)"
echo "   â€¢ /cashier/* - Cashier only (sessions, active, credits)"
echo "   â€¢ /dashboard - Any authenticated user"
echo ""
echo "ðŸ”‘ Test Credentials:"
echo "   â€¢ Admin: username='admin', password='admin123'"
echo "   â€¢ Cashier: username='cashier', password='cashier123'"
echo ""
echo "ðŸŽ¯ How it works:"
echo "   1. Unauthenticated users can only access login page (/)"
echo "   2. Direct navigation to protected routes redirects to login"
echo "   3. After login, users are redirected based on their role"
echo "   4. Authenticated users visiting / are redirected to their dashboard"
echo "   5. Role-based access: admin can't access cashier pages and vice versa"
echo "   6. Logout clears session and redirects to login"
echo ""
echo "ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation:"
echo "   â€¢ Client-side authentication using React Context"
echo "   â€¢ Route protection at component level"
echo "   â€¢ Persistent sessions using localStorage"
echo "   â€¢ Loading states and proper redirects"

echo "Server is running at: http://localhost:3000"
